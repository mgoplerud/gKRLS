Description: Kernel regularized least squares - also known as kernel ridge regression - is a flexible machine learning method. This package implements this method for generalized linear models and other models with random sketching to facilitate scalability. It provides a smoothing basis type (bs='gKRLS') for estimation using 'mgcv' and associated functions. It provides additional functions for estimating marginal effects after estimation, implementation for ensembles (via 'SuperLearning') and double/debiased machine learning (via 'DoubleML'). Chang and Goplerud (2023) <arxiv:2209.14355> provides further details.
