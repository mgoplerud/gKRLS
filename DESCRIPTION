Description: Kernel regularized least squares, also known as kernel ridge regression, 
    is a flexible machine learning method. This package implements this method for 
    generalized linear models and other models with random sketching to facilitate 
    scalability. It provides a smoothing basis type for estimation using 'mgcv' 
    and associated functions. It provides additional functions for estimating 
    marginal effects after estimation, implementation for ensembles 
    (via 'SuperLearning') and double/debiased machine learning (via 'DoubleML'). 
    Chang and Goplerud (2022) <arxiv:xx> provides further details.
